    <p>
      Bill Gates — the co-founder of Microsoft — is one of the most influential innovators of our time. 
      His vision of “a computer on every desk and in every home” changed the way the world works and communicates.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I admire most about Bill Gates is his passion for learning and giving back to society. 
      After building one of the largest tech companies in history, he devoted his energy to philanthropy, 
      working to eradicate diseases, improve education, and tackle climate change through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bill Gates inspires millions to dream big, stay curious, and use knowledge for the greater good. 
      His journey teaches us that success isn’t just about wealth — it’s about using our abilities to help others.
